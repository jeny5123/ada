  "body": "# ada\r\n\r\nOne of the worst offenders of non-representational media is the gaming industry. The gaming industry is notorious for having a severe gender bias towards males and encouraging senseless violence. We, however, believe that there is something more to video games - that they can be incredible tools that encourage personal growth and facilitate knowledge in an entertaining way. Our game, Ada, aims to do that. \r\n\r\nThis game features an original storyline that transforms the overused dystopian young adult genre, and a wide range of characters that contribute to the dynamics of the story. We used a program called gamemaker for the coding part of the game, photoshop for the graphics, and garageband for the music.  Through our project we are tackling down problems related to sexism and diversity by creating a transformative gaming experience.  We hope the engaging storyline, relatable characters and unique graphics can break the stereotypes of gaming and deliver a universal message for all genders and races. \r\n\r\nOur protagonist is named after Ada Lovelace, who was one of the first computer programmers . Ada is an extremely sheltered girl living with her wealthy parents. The game takes place in an Asian-inspired dystopian city that is eroding due to pollution and corruption. After traumatic experiences, Ada’s parents decide that there isn’t a future left for them in the rapidly-decaying world and cryogenically freeze themselves in hopes of waking up to a better, more peaceful time in the future. The official story starts as Ada wakes up to find the ruins of her old city covered in lush vegetation. \r\n\r\nFor the sake of avoiding spoilers, that’s all of the storyline we can give you. Of course, a game of this caliber and quality would take far longer than two weeks, but what we did finish is a demo of a prologue setting in the game - Ada’s house. The demo should be a good example of the rpg, pixelated style and puzzle mechanics we envision would be implemented in the completed version of the game. Thank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
